# My Vimrc

I love Vim. I've been using it for over a year now, and I know that still have more to learn. For iOS development, Xcode is still the obvious choice, but for anything else, I only choose Vim. I've taken the time to cultivate plugins and create my own functions and mappings to increase my productivity. 

Learning Vim takes time, and at first, it can be [frustrating](http://qr.ae/ROi9Vd), but I promise after exploring and experimenting with Vim, it'll be worth your time.

This is my vimrc file. I don't recommend straight up copying it (as it's built for my workflow), but I'd suggest reading [this post](https://melinysh.me/vim,/development,/commandline/2016/02/18/what-makes-a-vimrc.html) I wrote about the basics of a good vimrc. If you know of anything interesting that I should add, let me know.
